<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
Kitserver 2010 is an add-on program for Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 (and Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 DEMO). It is a loader and manager for various modules, where
each module is built as a (typically) independent DLL containing logic to 
enhance the game in particular aspect. While originally the Kitserver was 
developed to "serve" kits Pro Evolution Soccer 3, a lot more functionality 
has been added over the years.<br />
Below is a quick summary of the available features. Follow the link in the left column to get more details about a particular module.

<h3>2. Installation / Removal</h3>
</a>

<h5>2.1. Install</h5>

<p>
With XP and Vista, and now Windows 7 having more emphasis and enforcement of file ownership and 
different user rights, and promoting the use of "Standard User" accounts, i realized it was time 
to change the installation routine slightly, compared
to the previous versions of Kitserver. So, first new thing: you have a more traditional installer
now, well it's just a self-extractable archive with some logos :) Run it, and it will ask you
where you want your kitserver files extracted:
</p>

<img src="installer.png"/>

<p>You can leave the default directory specified in the installer, or you can put in your own.
The important thing is that you unpack the files into a place where you have full control
over the files (your HOME directory is one example of that.) This will ensure that you 
won't run into any File Virtualization surprises on Vista, and also that <b>you will NOT 
    need administrative privileges</b> to run the game with Kitserver. 
</p>

<p>Now go to that directory that you installed your kitserver to. You will see there
a folder named <b>Kitserver2010</b>. Open that folder, you should see something like this:

<img src="layout1.png"/>

<p>
Now, copy the two executables from your game folder to the Kitserver2010 folder - <b>pes2010.exe</b> and <b>settings.exe</b>. (<span class="devnote">Depending on your Windows settings, you may see them 
as simply <b>pes2010</b> and <b>settings</b> - with file extensions hidden. 
In fact, by default the file extensions of known file types are hidden, as you can see 
on the screenshot below).</span> So, now it should look like this:
</p>

<img src="layout2.png"/>

<p>Almost there! A couple more steps and we'll have the game running with Kitserver.<br />
Now open the <b>kitserver</b> folder and run the <b>manager.exe</b> program. 
</p>
<p><span class="devnote">This was previously called setup.exe, but Windows thinks that any
application named setup.exe wants administrative access, even though the kitserver's 
setup actually doesn't. Also, the name "setup" was always slightly misleading, so 
i decided to rename it to more neutral - manager - because it manages the attachment
of kitserver to the game EXE files.</span></p>

<img src="layout3.png"/>

<p>
Now select the game executable (it should actually already be preselected). You can
also select your settings.exe (if say you wish to by-pass the quality 
checks, for example. Otherwise, it is not necessary). 
Once you select the files, click <b>"Attach"</b> button.
What this does is it "connects" the kitserver to the game: now whenever you start the game (using that particular game EXE), the Kitserver DLLs will be loaded into memory. If all went well, you should see a picture like this:
</p>

<img src="manager.png"/>

<p>
If you decide that you don't want to use Kitserver any longer, run manager.exe again and click <b>"Detach"</b>, and it will disconnect the kitserver from the game EXE. 
<span class="devnote">(This is useful when troubleshooting
crashes: you can always temporarily detach Kitserver from the game to verify that the game
runs fine without it. And then re-attach the Kitserver later).</span>
You can also install/remove Kitserver
only for one exe by setting the other one to "no action".
</p>

<p>Now for one last step, before we can run the game with kitserver:<br />
<span class="note">We need to make sure there exists a file called <b>config.txt</b> in the
kitserver folder. If you're upgrading your Kitserver, then you might already have it in there,
in which case the installation/upgrade is done. If not, then it's easy enough to create the
config.txt file: just run the Kitserver's <a href="#config">configuration tool</a>, click "Save", 
and it will make the config.txt for you.
</p>

<p>That's it. You're ready to launch the game.<br />
<span class="note">REMEMBER: you need to start the game using the game EXE (pes2010.exe) in Kitserver2010 folder, because that is the one that has the kitserver attached to it.</span>
</p>

<p class="devnote">For folks who had been using kitserver for some time, it is worth noting that
it is still possible to install the kitserver the "old" way: in the game folder. Everything would
still work fine, as long as you do everything as Administrator: run config.exe, run manager.exe,
and you have to run the game as administrator too. I would honestly not recommend doing that, but
instead adopt the new way. It is safer and you don't need to worry about administrative privileges,
and you don't run into File Virtualization issues which can lead to nasty surprises, and many
hours spent muttering things like: "why does my config.txt show correct setting, but in the
game i don't see the effect? What is going on?!!..."</p>

<h5>2.2. Uninstall</h5>

<p>Uninstall is very easy: just delete the <b>Kitserver2010</b> folder, and that's it.<br /> Kitserver 
doesn't write into system folders, or anything of that sort, so removal is very simple.
</p>

<p>Also, it is worth reminding that you can always temporarily detach the kitserver from the game exe, and then re-attach it back, by using the manager program (as described in 2.1 section above). This is 
useful when suddenly you get game crashes, and you are not sure whether Kitserver is at fault, or
there is some other reason.</p>

<h5>2.3. Installing KONAMI patches</h5>

<p>From time to time, Konami releases patches to the game. There is already 1.01 and 1.02 patches,
and there probably will be more released in the future. When you install these patches, you get
a brand new game executable (pes2010.exe) among other things. It is important to realise that 
Konami patch doesn't now about your Kitserver installation, and therefore the game EXE in your 
<b>Kitserver2010</b> folder will still be the old one.</p>

<p>So what you need to do is copy the new game EXE over to the Kitserver2010 folder, then run the
<b>manager.exe</b> program and attach the kitserver to the new EXE. Assuming, of course, that Kitserver
supports the new EXE, that's all there is to it. Now you can again start the game from Kitserver2010
folder.
</p>

<h5>2.4. Advanced usage of manager.exe</h5>
<p>
The kitserver <b>manager.exe</b> program can also be run without GUI - in a so-called batch or command-line mode. This can be useful, if kitserver is part of a bigger patch, which contains an installer, and typically the last step of the installer is to attach kitserver to the game EXE file. This can be accomplished by running the manager like this:
</p>

<p class="devnote">
manager --install --gfile={game-exe} --sfile={settings-exe}<br />
manager --remove --gfile={game-exe} --sfile={settings-exe}<br />
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
<b>manager --install --gfile=..\pes2010.exe --sfile=..\settings.exe</b>
</p>

<h5>2.5. config.txt</h5>
<p>Kitserver uses a file called <b>config.txt</b> as its main configuration file. A lot of things are specified there, including which modules
to load, what settings those modules should use, and etc. Go to your <b>kitserver</b> folder and you should see a file called <span class="devnote">config-sample.txt</span>. (I gave it
a different name on purpose: so that those who upgrade their kitserver installation don't accidently overwrite their existing config.txt). If you aren't
upgrading then the chances are that you don't have an existing config.txt, in which case just rename (or copy) the sample config into <b>config.txt</b> (or run <a href="#config">configuration tool</a>, click "Save" and it will do the same thing). Otherwise
you may want to compare the sample config with yours and see if you need to make changes to your config: such as add new modules in the [kload] section,
for example.</p>
<p class="note">Remember: if you don't have config.txt in your kitserver folder, kitserver will not do much. But it will log the fact that it couldn't find the config.txt. So if you think kitserver doesn't work for you, check the pes2010.log file for error messages</p>

<p><a class="backlink" href="#">Top</a></p>
<h3>3. Usage and configuration</h3>

<h5>3.1. Main configuration file: config.txt</h5>

<p>The main configuration file for kitserver - config.txt - is located in the
kitserver folder. If you don't have it there - re-read the end of Install section (2.1) above.
Here is an example of what can be in config.txt:
</p>

<pre>
[afs2fs]
debug = 1
img.dir = "c:\mypesfiles\root1"

[camera]
angle = 30

[kload]
dll = zlib1.dll
dll = libpng13.dll
dll = afsio.dll
dll = kserv.dll
dll = afs2fs.dll
dll = lodmixer.dll
dll = camera.dll
dll = time.dll
dll = speeder.dll
gdb.dir = "."

</pre>

<p>
Each module can have its own configuration section, which starts with <b>[<i>module-name</i>]</b>, and typically has one or more options following it. Now, normally you wouldn't need to modify config.txt file, except for the cases, when you need to modify the behaviour of a particular module (DLL), or enable/disable such DLL.
</p>

<p>To disable a particular module - just comment out the corresponding line in the <b>[kload]</b> section by putting a '#' symbol at the beginning. (Or you can delete that line altogether.)
</p>

<p class="note">The order of the DLLs is important. In particular: <b>zlib1.dll</b>, <b>libpng13.dll</b>, <b>afsio.dll</b> must be loaded in that order before <b>kserv.dll</b>; <b>afs2fs.dll</b> after <b>kserv.dll</b>. Only in very rare situations you should try re-arranging the DLLs.</p>

<a name="config"><br /></a>
<h5>3.2. Configuration tool - config.exe</h5>

<p>Formerly known as lodcfg.exe (it used to be the GUI tool for LOD mixer only, but now it covers other configuration options as well), this simple GUI program allows to modify some configuration settings in config.txt. It's a helper tool and all that it does, you can also do manually, by editing config.txt in your favourite text editor. <span class="note">In fact, some things you can <i>only</i> do manually - like adding and removing modules (DLLs)</span>. But for simple things - like changing resolution, or choosing camera angle - it's faster and easier to just launch <b>config.exe</b>, quickly adjust things, then click [Save] button, and you're done.

<h3>4. AFS2FS Module (afs2fs.dll)</h3>

<p>
This module allows to organize your BIN-files into folders on disk, instead of inserting them into AFS(*.img) files, which is sometimes a pain, and may require a lot of extra disk space.
</p>

<p>Several people over the last few years had suggested similar solutions, but ultimately it was <b>Str@teG</b> who kept talking about this idea of organizing BINs into folders, and eventually i decided to just go ahead and do it. So now this is realized in the this module - afs2fs.dll. From personal experience, i know that people are sometimes reluctant to install big patches that require an AFS-rebuild, not because it's particularly difficult or anything, but because it can be time-consuming and disk-space-hungry. With afs2fs, this is now very easy: you just put the BIN into correct folder and that's it. And, of course, there are no size constraints - the bins can be as large as needed!
</p>

<p>The module is also handy, when you want to try a patch without risking
totally destroying the content that you already have. Putting a new patch into
a separate AFS-root and modifying config.txt is all you need to get it going.
Removal as easy too: delete the correspoding "img.dir" line in config.txt, and
then delete the AFS-root folder. Multiple patches is no longer a management nightmare :). (See more info on AFS-roots in the sections below)</p>

<h5>4.1. How to set up the folders</h5>

<p>
Start by choosing a location where you would be putting your files. 
For example, let's take <b>c:\mypesfiles\root1</b>. This will be your so-called
AFS-root. Inside that folder, create a folder called <b>img</b>. (This is 
very important that you have the folder named "img", since the game relies
on particular names). Then, inside <b>img</b>, create folders, as needed, 
named - <b>dt00.img</b>, <b>dt01.img</b>, <b>dt0b.img</b>, and so for. 
That's where you're going to be putting the BIN-files. 
</p>

<p class="note">It's important to name the folders correctly: a folder must 
have exactly the same name as the corresponding AFS-file. For instance, 
if you call a folder dt00, instead of dt00.img, things will not work.
</p>

<p>This is how my <b>img</b> folder looks:

<img src="afs2fs.png"/>
</p>

<h5>4.2. How to name the files</h5>

<p class="devnote">In general, you can name the files whichever way you want, but you must follow one rule: there must be a BIN number in the name, and it must be preceded by an underscore character ('_'). Also, the filenames CANNOT be longer than 63 characters.
</p>

<p>
Examples of correctly named files:<br /><br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">unknown_317.bin</span><br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">goalnet_41.bin</span><br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">ball_9.bin</span><br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">unknow_9</span> (.bin extension is optional)<br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">music_11.adx</span> (a file can have a different extension: .adx is typically used for music and sound files)<br />
</p>

<p>
Examples of incorrectly named files:<br /><br />
<span style="color:#800;font-weight:bold">unnamed10.bin</span> - no underscore symbol before the BIN number.<br />
<span style="color:#800;font-weight:bold">face.bin</span> - no BIN number.<br />
</p>

<h5>4.3. AFS roots</h5>
<p>
By default, the AFS2FS module will not search any "special" default paths. Instead you must specify your AFS roots explicitly: In <b>[afs2fs]</b> section of config.txt, you can speficy the location of your root, which can be anywhere on your hard disk. You can also have multiple roots, which is very useful if you have several patches, and you don't want to lose track of which BINs came from which patches (so that you can easily uninstall a patch by just deleting its root folder). 
</p>

<p>Here is an example with 3 different roots are configured:</p>

<pre>
[afs2fs]
img.dir = "c:\mypesfiles\root1"
img.dir = "patch-RPL"
img.dir = "afs-root3"
</pre>

<p>
The order of the roots is significant, when it comes to resolving "collisions". Say, you have a <b>dt0b.img/ball_9.bin</b> in the second root (patch-RPL), and <b>dt0b.img/superball_9.bin</b> in the third root (afs-root3). Even though the files are actually named differently, they intend to replace the same BIN - #9 from dt0b.img, and therefore we have a "collision". <span class="devnote">The rule is simple: the lower root in the list wins.</span> Which means that in this situation, the <b>dt0b.img/superball_9.bin</b> file will be used, since its root is listed last in the [afs2fs] section.</p>

<p class="note">IMPORTANT thing to remember: 
The root is the folder that <i>contains</i> "img", not the "img" folder itself. In other words, if the full pathname is <b>c:\mypesfiles\root1\img"</b>, then in the config.txt you should have: <b>img.dir = "c:\mypesfiles\root1"</b>
</p>

<h5>4.4. Names for balls and songs</h5>
<p>
When replacing songs with AFS2FS, it is also possible to change the title of the song and the artist's name, by using a <b>songs.txt</b> map-file, which should be put into afs-root folder.<br />
<br />
Here's an example of such songs.txt file:
</p>

<pre>
# Song names map
# Format: &lt;binId&gt;, "&lt;title&gt;", "&lt;artist&gt;" 
# Note that double quotes are required.

11, "Вне зоны доступа", "Город 312"
12, "I'm mad about you", "Sting"
</pre>

<p class="devnote" style="font-weight:normal">IMPORTANT: as with all other map-files and config files that Kitserver uses, 
the encoding of the file needs to be <b>Utf-8</b> or <b>Unicode</b>, especially
of you use non-latin symbols - like in the example above. (<b>ANSI</b> encoding
is ok if you only use Latin-1 characters.)
</p>

<p>
Similarly with balls, if you are replacing ball BINs, you probably want to
adjust their names too. One easy way to do that is to use a <b>balls.txt</b> map-file, which should be put into afs-root folder:

<pre>
# Ball names map
# Format: &lt;ball-number&gt;, "&lt;name&gt;"
# Note that double quotes are required.
# (Ball numbers go from 1 to 16)

8, "Nike-ball Blue"
9, "Мячик плохонький"
</pre>

<p>It is worth noting that each afs-root folder can have its own songs.txt
and balls.txt. Since each afs-root may contain music files and ball files,
it makes sense to tie the names to them this way. If you have multiple afs-roots(as when for example you have multiple patches, and each patch uses its own
afs-root), then the "conflicts" are resolved the same way as they are with BINs (see above for details). In other words, if one afs-root has name for song 11, and another afs-root has a name for song 11, then whichever afs-root is specified lower in the list (in config.txt) - will win.</p>

<p>Here's a picture to clarify where <b>songs.txt</b> and <b>balls.txt</b> files should be placed. In this case "root1" is my afs-root:

<img src="names.png"/>
</p>
<a name="kserv"><br /></a>
<p><a class="backlink" href="#">Top</a></p>
<h3>5. Kserv Module (kserv.dll)</h3>

<p>
Kserv module is responsible for serving kits from the GDB ("<b>G</b>ame content <b>D</b>ata<b>B</b>ase") during the game. The main feature of it is that you are not limited to the slots that dt0c.img has for the kits, and you can assign a kit to any team. 
</p>

<p class="devnote" style="font-weight:normal">
Kserv was historically the first module implemented in the original Kitserver program, made for PES3. That's where the <b>Kitserver</b> name originated from. Later, as more functionality were introduced as new modules, to avoid confusion, we changed the name of the module that serves kits to <b>kserv</b>, while Kitserver name now refers to the entire program.
</p>

<h5>5.1 GDB organization</h5>

<p>
The GDB contains a folder named <b>uni</b>, which is responsible for storing
the team kits (uniforms). The single most important file inside <b>uni</b> is called <b>map.txt</b>.
This file tells kitserver where to find the kits for particular team. As you know, each team has a unique id - an integer number from 0 to 340. For every team in the GDB, you must specify in the map.txt where the kits for this team are. Here is an example:

<pre>
# This config maps team number into folder name
# Format: &lt;team-num&gt;,"&lt;folder name&gt;"
# Example: 23,"Russia"

23,"National\Russia"
10, "National\Germany"
7, "National\England"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<div class="note">IMPORTANT: Double quotes are not required, but advised - just so that there is no ambiguity about folder name. IDs for the teams will depend on whether you have installed any patches, but for default option file, you can see the IDs here - <a href="uni.txt">uni.txt</a> file.</div>
</p>

<p class="devnote">
(If you haven't updated your data using Konami downloadable update, 
then the team IDs can be found in <a href="uni_org.txt">uni_org.txt</a>)
</p>

<p>
Please note that the sample GDB (provided with kitserver) is just one possible way of organizing the teams and 
folders. It uses "EPL" folder to group all english teams, "National" - to group all national
teams, and so for. You may find that you just prefer a flat list of folders - without these
extra groups. In that case, just modify the <b>map.txt</b> file accordingly, and create
the structure of folders that you prefer. That's the main advantage of having map.txt - the
flexibility of kit organization.
</p>

<p>
You can see from map.txt above that in order to find a kit for team #23, the kitserver needs to go to the 
folder <b>GDB\uni\National\Russia</b>. This folder will contain all of the kits that are
available to team #23. Inside it, you must create an individual folder for each kit. Like this:

<img src="russia.png"/>

For players, 1st kit must have a folder name <b>pa</b>, 2nd - <b>pb</b>. Extra kits can have 
any folder names that start with letter "p". I found it useful to prefix all extra kits with 
<b>px-</b>. For example, <b>px-redwhite</b>. For the goalkeepers, 1st kit must be in the folder
<b>ga</b>, 2nd - in the <b>gb</b>. Extra kits can have any folder names that start with letter "g".
</p>

<div class="note">IMPORTANT: Folder name acts as a kind of ID for kitserver, which puts the 
additional restriction on all those folder names: they cannot contain spaces, and preferably
they should be relatively short, and in English,French or other language withing Latin1 
(iso8859-1) character set. Typically, if you want to make sure kitserver can properly
find/read the folder, just use latin characters, digits, underscore, and the dash (minus sign).
</div>

<p>
Now let's move on inside one of the kit folders. Take <b>pa</b>, for example.

<img src="pa.png" />

See the table below for explanation of each file:
</p>

<div class="note">Images must be in PNG format: 8-bit paletted or 4-bit paletted (those may be used with fonts/numbers). So the filename must have 
a ".png" extension.</b></div>

<h5>5.2. Extra kits</h5>

<p>
A team can have more kits than just 1st (<b>pa</b>) and 2nd (<b>pb</b>). 
You can put additional kits to their own folders and then be able to 
choose them in the game. (As i mentioned before, the folders for
extra kits must be named starting with letter <b>p</b> - for player kits,
and letter <b>g</b> - for goalkeepers. For example: <b>px-white</b>, or
<b>gc-third</b>.) To use an extra kit, you will need to press the "hotkeys" 
when the uniform selection screen is shown (see screenshot below):
</p>

<p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Hot-key</th><th>Action</th></tr>
    <tr><td>[<b>1</b>]</td><td>Change home team player kit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>[<b>2</b>]</td><td>Change away team player kit</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p class="devnote">Please note that it is currently NOT possible to select
goalkeeper kits, but this feature will be implemented in the future
versions of kserv.dll. Extra kits will also be supported for goalkeepers.
</p>

<img src="uniselect.jpg" />

<h5>5.3. config.txt</h5>

<p>
This is the attribute configuration file.
As before, it is just a plain text file - you can use Notepad or any other text editor to
view or modify it. For each folder, you should have a <b>config.txt</b> file in it. Here is an example config.txt from <b>pa</b> folder:
</p>

<pre>

<h5>5.4. "Techfit" models</h5>

<p>In their DLC updates, KONAMI included new models which use different kit
textures - the one where two variants of a kit coexist in the same picture:
a tight fit, and a normal one.</p>

<p>Only certain models support those textures, and as of DLC 1.07, they
are: 256,257,259,260,261, and 264. Kserv module 9.2.0.5 supports those 
without any additional configuration. However, if another update is released
and more models like that are added, it is now possible to specify them
in the [kserv] section of config.txt. You need to list all of them like this:
</p>

<pre>
[kserv]
...
techfit.model = 256
techfit.model = 257
techfit.model = 259
techfit.model = 260
techfit.model = 261
techfit.model = 264

<h3>6. LOD Mixer (lodmixer.dll)</h3>

<p>
LOD-Mixer is the module that allows to fine-tune some aspects of PES2010 graphics engine.<br />
Currently the following features are implemented: screen resolution and aspect ratio correction. All of these can be configured manually in kitserver's main 
configuration file (kitserver/config.txt), but you can also use Kitserver's <a href="#config">configuration tool</a> (<b>config.exe</b>). 
</p>

<h5>6.1. Aspect Ratio.</h5>
<p>
Many LCD monitors are neither 4:3 nor 16:9. Often, a 16:10 ratio is
used, or even 16:9.6. This results in the picture being distored: players either
too fat or too skinny, and ball is not round. In this year version, Konami 
are again using the black bars (as they were in PES2009) to compensate for the
case when aspect-ratio is different (<b>LB</b> checkbox). However, if you 
don't like the black bars, then run settings.exe, turn off the LB checkbox, and then use Kitserver's aspect-ratio correction feature instead:
</p>

<p>
With LOD Mixer, you can set the aspect ratio to whatever you want. Either let
LOD Mixer calculate it automatically - at run-time, using the current screen
width and height in pixels - or set the value manually. Automatic way would work quite
accurately, assuming the pixel is square. Sometimes, however, you would want to
set it manually. For example, i play on widescreen monitor, but using a 800x600 
resolution, because my video card is not powerful enough. The automatic 
calculation would give 4:3, but since the view is stretched to fill the entire 
screen, we need to account for that. Setting aspect ratio to 1.6 (which is a 
natural AR for my laptop) does the trick.
</p>

<h5>6.2. Screen Resolution.</h5>
<p>
You can set any screen resolution you want, if you play in a Windowed mode. Even
crazy screens like 1234x487 will work, but you're likely to suffer from 
performance problems on such cases.
Hidden fullscreen resolutions are fully unlocked now as well. However, only those
that your video card really supports in full-screen mode, will work. If you 
accidently choose an unsupported fullscreen resolution, then PES should still 
be able to start in a window.
</p>

<h5>6.3. Controller check</h5>
<p>
This feature may be useful to people who like to play a tournament - a league or
cup together. PES 2010 doesn't allow human players to control both teams, unless
both of their selected teams are playing against each other in the match. With
this new feature, you can remove that limitation. 
Now, even if it is for example, P1 vs. COM game, or P2 vs. COM - 
you can freely select which team you control
with each controller. So, you can both play on the same team, or you can let 
your friend control the opposition - to make things more interesting.
You can also now choose a "Spectator" mode for in tournaments.
</p>
<p>Another possiblity opened by this feature: in training mode, you can
play for defence and/or goalkeeper. Very handy to train penalty saves!
</p>

<h5>6.4. LOD configuration.</h5>
<p>
LOD (Level-Of-Detail) algorithms are used in graphics engines to improve both
the picture quality and the speed of rendering, when drawing objects at various
distances from the viewer. The basic idea is that when the object is close to
the camera, one (very detailed) model is used. When it is far - another, simpler
model with less detail is used instead. It's much faster to render a low-poly
model of the object, and it typically looks better, when drawn in small size,
because it suffers less from aliasing. In theory, at least, 
that is how it is supposed to work.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, PES series had always suffered from an overly-
conservative LOD configuration, where the switch to low-poly models would happen
way too soon, and that would result in various visible artifacts. In PES4-PES6,
examples were: balding players, and missing details on kits. In PES2008-PES2010, the players and referees appear to have blurred generic faces, once they move slightly away from
the camera.
</p>
<p>
So, if you have a good PC and a powerful videocard with GPU cycles to spare, you
may fancy tuning the LOD sligtly to make the game engine display more detailed
models, even when they players are a bit away from the camera (Animation quality seems
to be affected by this as well). To do that, <b>move the sliders to the right.</b>
</p>
<p>
Also, if on the contrary, your machine is stuggling to run the game at a smooth
frame rate, you can try moving the LOD sliders in the opposite direction - thus
making the engine switch to the low-poly models sooner than normal. This may
improve the framerate, although at the expense of picture quality. To achieve
that, <b>move the sliders to the left.</b>
</p>

<h6>6.4.1. Additional LOD settings</h6>
<p>
The lodmixer module also supports 6 more LOD settings, which aren't shown
as sliders in configuration tool. Those are LOD settings for so called 
"active player". This is the player that is controlled by human player
during free kicks and corner kicks. "Active player" LODs are also used by
the game during uniform selection screen and in Edit Mode.</p>

<p>
Basically, i got lazy, and didn't feel like adding 6 more sliders to the
configuration tool :) And also couldn't quite figure out where exactly to
put them, without totally clobbering the UI. But you can still use them,
by adding them manually to [lodmixer] section in config.txt.  You
probably not going to use all of them, but you might find this one handy:
<b>lod.active.player.fk.s1</b>. I put this setting into the config-sample.txt,
and set the value of it to 0.010 - this gives maximum detail for the 
player taking a free kick.</p>

<p>Here is the full list of "active player" LODs with their default values.
Feel free to experiment with them, if you really want to:

<pre>
lod.active.player.ck.s1 = 0.010
lod.active.player.ck.s2 = 0.010
lod.active.player.ck.s3 = 0.010
lod.active.player.fk.s1 = 100.0
lod.active.player.fk.s2 = 0.010
lod.active.player.fk.s3 = 0.010
</pre>

<h6>6.4.2. Choosing optimal LOD config</h6>

<P>
Configuring LOD well takes time and is best done via trial-and-error method. (If it was
easy, it would've been probably done right in the first place!) I'd like to mention a
few considertations here that should help you with LOD configs.</p>

<p><span class="devnote">Myth #1: if I move all sliders to the right, I will always have the best picture.</span><br />
That is simply not true. You will get the most detailed and expensive rendering, yes, but 
NOT NECESSARILY the one that looks the best. More-detailed objects at far distance
actually look worse than less-detailed ones, because of the aliasing effect.</p>

<p><span class="devnote">Myth #2: my GPU (video card) is really good, surely it can handle anything thrown at it.</span><br />
That is not true either. Current generation of games has become quite sofisticiated and 
resource-hungry. GPU and CPU are working hard to process the rendering, physics, AI logic.
60 FPS is the typical minimum frame-rate at which a game needs to run, in order to provide
nice and smooth gameplay. That means the rendering of the entire scene must fit into 1/60th of 
a second and still leave some time for other tasks to be done. (Physics, in particular is often
run at the same rate as rendering, so that the picture doesn't suffer from noise.) To make sure
rendering time doesn't escalate dramatically as more objects are rendered, LOD is often employed
as the optimization technique. By moving all sliders to the right, you are effectively
disabling the LOD algorithm and telling your GPU: "render all objects on the screen at the
most possible detail. And if you fry while doing that, i don't care!". Ok, so maybe it's not a funny example,
but you get the point.</p>

<p>Now, coming back to our game, as i said, in many cases, you only really need to adjust 1 slider 
or two to get the desired effect, and still keep the smooth frame-rate. Let's consider some examples:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Problem:</b> during regular gameplay, the game engine switches to low-quality models of players too soon, so we have artifacts like washed-out faces, untucked shirts suddenly become tucked-in, players models become too robot-like. <b>Solution:</b> slide "PLAYERS (Gameplay) S3" slider to the right - around 0.060 or maybe 0.050. That should take care of it. You may also want to try moving the S2 slider to something around 0.70, but on my card that didn't really give noticeable difference.
    <img src="lod1.png"/></li>

    <li><b>Problem:</b> during free-kicks, the faces of the players in the wall are all washed-out, even though they can be pretty close to the camera. Similarly - with corners.<b>Solution:</b> move the 
    "PLAYERS (Cut-scenes, Highlights, etc.) S3" slider to the right. The value 0.050 should be enough.
    <img src="lod2.png"/></li>

    <li><b>Problem:</b> referees suffer from the same problems as described above - during both gameplay and during replays. <b>Solution:</b> move the REFEREES sliders to the right. Again, you don't really need to max them out - something around 0.060 - 0.050 should be good.
    <img src="lod3.png"/></li>

    <li><b>Problem:</b> during free kick, the player that is taking it is not
    rendered with full detail, even though i have all LOD sliders set to maximum
    quality. <b>Solution:</b> use the "active player" LOD setting (not shown in config.exe), called <b>lod.active.player.fk.s1</b> - set it to 0.010 in [lodmixer] section of config.txt file.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are just some examples. You might notice some other artifacts that you'd like to fix.
The main thing is: experiment with your LOD configuration, don't just blindly set everything 
to maximum quality - on most systems that will result in stuttering and loss of frame-rate, because your 
GPU (and CPU also) gets a lot more work to do. In many cases, adjusting just one or two sliders gets the 
effect you want, without hurting the frame-rate.</p>

<h3>7. Camera module (camera.dll)</h3>

<p>
For reasons known only to Konami product managers, for the third(!) year running, they took away the interface feature that allowed to adjust camera angle (it was in PES3-PES6, but it disappeared starting with PES2008). The underlying logic is still present in the game executable though, and this module allows you to take advantage of it. You can adjust the camera angle: standard values are 0 - 9, but you can actually set a bigger value, which will result in camera turning even more. For example, i like to play with angle value set to 30.</p>

<p>Choose any value from 0 to 2^32-1. Angles like 20, 40, 100 give quite a different perspective of play. More fun :)
</p>

<p>Use Kitserver configuration tool (<b>config.exe</b>) or, you can also edit
your config.txt file manually, like this:

<pre>
[camera]
angle = 30
</pre>
</p>

<h3>8. Time expander (time.dll)</h3>

<p>
This tiny module allows to stretch the length of the match to normal 90 minutes, if you want, but really you can choose any number of minutes between 1 and 255.
Going beyond 90 will make the seconds flow slower than normal. Also, another extreme is setting the match time to 1 minute. This is a whole new experience too: you have to really treasure the ball - keep posession, or you risk not getting it back at all, before the final whistle! Also, if you get a scoring chance, better put it away, because chances are it'll be the only one you get.
</p>

<p>
To set the match time use <b>match.time</b> setting:

<pre>
[time]
match.time = 90
</pre>

<h3>9. Speeder module (speeder.dll)</h3>

<p>Not everyone is satisfied with the pace of the gameplay. It must be said
that it is not an easy thing to get this aspect of simulating a football 
match correctly. Many factors are in play, and a lot depends on hardware. 
Personally, i think Konami did a decent job at that, but many folks find
the gameplay too fast.</p>

<p>Several techniques of slowing the game down exist, and not one of them
is perfect, but all work to some extent. The speeder module basically slows
down the clock, sort of tricking the game into running slower. This is not
an ideal solution either, but if a small adjustment is used, it can still
look real, play well, and actually provide a smoother gameplay. Don't
consider it a silver bullet though. It might work well for you, but it 
also may not deliver everything you had hoped for :) (One side-effect,
for example, is that if you set your match time to 10 minutes, but you
have the Game Speed set to 0.9, the actual match time will be approximately
11.1 minutes.)</p>

<p>It is possible to decrease the game speed and also to increase it.
The <a href="#config">configuration tool</a> has the 'Game Speed' slider 
for easy adjustments.
The value <b>1.0</b> gives the default unchanged speed. Less than 1.0 - slower
gameplay, greater than 1.0 - faster gameplay. <span class="devnote">It is not advised to use values lower than 0.7, because the music/commentary starts to break up. Also values larger than 2.5 are not supported. It is already ridiculously fast with 2.5!</span>.

</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can set the game speed adjustment 
manually in config.txt, by using <b>count.factor</b> setting:

<pre>
[speeder]
count.factor = 0.95
</pre>

<h3>10. Leagues module (leagues.dll)</h3>

<p>
League server allows you to add leagues to PES 2010 ( it does not work with Master League yet ). It works like any other module of kit server you will just have to add it to your Kit Server config.txt file. Then with a few settings you will be able to add leagues for National and Club Teams.</p>

<h5>10.1. Leagues Editor 2010</h5>

<p>
In order to be able to edit league slots, you will need <b>Leagues Editor 2010</b> by Stelios and ModdingWay team.<br /> It can be downloaded here:
<a href="http://downloads.moddingway.com/file/749.html">http://downloads.moddingway.com/file/749.html</a>
</p>

<h5>10.2. Leagues management</h5>

<p>Create 2 txt files in the kitserver folder: <b>national.txt</b> and <b>club.txt</b>. In this files you specify each league line by line, like this:</p>

<pre>
XX, LEAGUE_NAME, LEAGUE_LOGO_NAME
</pre>

<p><b>XX</b> stands for the slot of the teams (unnamed_1974.bin@dt0f editable with Leagues Editor 2010), e.g. 00 for Europe Slot.<br />
<b>LEAGUE_NAME</b> is the actual league name, e.g. Europe.<br />
<b>LEAGUE_LOGO_NAME</b> is the name of the league’s logo. This is the name of the logo on your dt05.img which is normally something like category_xx, e.g. category_00 for Europe’s logo.
</p>

<p>Example:<br /> 
To create the original Europe you need to add line:</p>
<pre>00, Europe, category_00</pre> 
<p>For original Africa you should add line:</p>
<pre>03, Africa, category_01</pre>
