<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
Kitserver 11 is an add-on program for Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 (and Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 DEMO). It is a loader and manager for various modules, where
each module is built as a (typically) independent DLL containing logic to 
enhance the game in particular aspect. While originally the Kitserver was 
developed to "serve" kits for Pro Evolution Soccer 3, a lot more functionality 
has been added over the years.<br />
Below is a quick summary of the available features. Follow the link in the left column to get more details about a particular module.

<h3>2. Installation / Removal</h3>
</a>

<h5>2.1. Install</h5>

<p>
With XP and Vista, and now Windows 7 having more emphasis and enforcement 
of file ownership and different user rights, and promoting the use of 
"Standard User" accounts, the installation routine of Kitserver has changed. 
If you are a "seasoned" kitserver user, please read this carefully, because it
will save you a lot of unnecessary hair-pulling.
</p>

<img src="installer.png"/>

<p>In many cases, following the 3 steps, as outlined by the message in the
installer window, will be all that you need to do. If so, then great, go on
and enjoy the game with new features that Kitserver adds. :)</p>

<p>You can leave the default directory as specified by the installer, or 
you can put in your own. The important thing is that you choose a folder
that you have full ownership of. (Your HOME directory is one good example 
of that. Another good candidates are: "My Documents" folder or Desktop).
This is particularly important on Vista, because this way we sidestep all
the nasty surprises of Vista File Virtualization. Also, this makes
sure that <b>you will NOT need administrative privileges</b> to run the 
game under the control of Kitserver. 
</p>

<p>Once installer unpacks the files into the folder of your choice, go there.
You should see a folder named <b>Kitserver11</b>. Open it, and you should see 
the following files:</p>

<img src="layout1.png"/>

<p>Next step is to make sure you have a file called <b>config.txt</b>.<br />
If you are installing Kitserver 11 for the first time, you probably do not
have an existing config.txt. In that case, just run the 
<a href="#configtool">configuration tool</a> program, called <b>config.exe</b>,
press [Save] button, and it will create a config.txt file for you.
</p>

<p>If, however, you are upgrading from previous version of Kitserver, then
you already have an existing config.txt, which you probably will want to 
re-use. (For instance, it contains your carefully configured LOD settings,
which you definitely don't want to lose!). If that's the case, then you will
need to compate config-sample.txt with your existing config.txt, and (if 
neede) make the necessary changes to config.txt
</p>

<h5>2.2. Uninstall</h5>

<p>Uninstall is very easy: just delete the <b>Kitserver11</b> folder, when
you no longer need it. Kitserver doesn't write into system folders, or 
anything of that sort, so removal is very simple.
</p>


<h3>3. Running the game</h3>

<h5>3.1. Running the game with Kitserver: KRUN-WAY</h5>

<p>So now you have the <b>config.txt</b> file, and we are ready to launch
the game under the "guidance" of Kitserver. There is a couple ways to do
that, and we will go through both of them in this documentation.</p>

<p>First, let's try the simplest approach. 
With Kitserver 11.0.0, a new tool was introduced: <b>krun.exe - Kitserver 
Game Launcher</b>. This is the tool that we will now use to run the game under
the control of Kitserver: just double-click on krun.exe and the game should
start after a few seconds delay.
</p>

<p>By default, krun will consult your Windows registry, to find out
where you have the game installed, and try to launch an executable from that
folder, called PES2011.exe. In most typical scenario, this is exactly what 
you want :)
</p>

<p class="devnote">People who had been using Kitserver for a few years now,
will notice that this is different from how things worked before: Kitserver
no longer modifies the game EXE in-place, but instead makes a modified copy
of it in the "temp" folder, and then the modified module is executed 
as a child process of <b>krun</b> program.
The new way maybe somewhat unfamiliar, but it actually
solves many security-related problems that surfaced with using the old
system.</p>

<h5>3.2. Running the game with Kitserver: MANAGER-WAY</h5>

<p>This used to be the "standard" way to work with kitserver, before the
introduction of krun. There are still scenarios, where it is easier to
do it the old way: for example for patchmakers that release a big patch
that includes their own modified version of game exe, a kitserver with
pre-configured config.txt, img-folders, GDB, and so for, it is easier
to just pre-attach kitserver to the game exe and let users to launch
the game "the normal way"- by double-clicking on the the patched game 
executable.</p>

<p>If you are a long-term user of Kitserver (maybe even from the glory 
days of PES3!), then you are probably also more acustomed to using 
manager.exe, instead of krun. That's fine. Both ways can be used
successfully, if certain steps are taken to avoid common pitfals.
</p>

<p>To use the manager program, you need to put your entire <b>kitserver11</b>
folder into the same directory, where you have the game exe that you want
to attach kitserver to. Two ways to do it:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Copy game exe to the parent folder of <b>kitserver11</b></li>
    <li>If you installed the game into a folder that you have <b>full ownership</b> of - for example, something like D:\Games\PES2011, then you can just copy the kitserver11 folder into D:\Games\PES2011. <span class="note">DO NOT DO THIS, IF YOU HAVE THE GAME IN <b>C:\Program Files</b>! It is a system folder, and things do not work there consistently, unless you do everything as Administrator</span></li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, go to kitserver11 folder, and run <b>manager.exe</b>. If you placed the
files correctly, then you will see manager showing you the list of game
executables that you can Attach/Detach kitserver to. Click [Attach] button,
and wait for the manager to confirm that the attachment was successful.
Now go one level up in the folder hierarchy and double-click on the game
exe (to which you just attached the kitserver) and the game should start.
</p>

<h5>3.3. Advanced ways to use krun.exe</h5>

<p>We have already covered the simplest way to use krun tool. However,
it may be the case that you have a more elaborate setup. Maybe 
you have alternative EXEs installed, perhaps those that came from a 
community-created patch or patches. So let's
say instead of PES2011.exe from your game folder, you want to launch the game
using this exe: <b>C:\myPesPatch\PES2011_patched.exe</b>.
</p>

<p>This is also possible to do with krun tool: you just need to create a
configuration file for it, which contains the full pathname of the exe. We
make a text file called <b>krun-config.txt</b>, which now has the format
similar to that of config.txt. You will need to have a [krun] section in it,
and the option to specify EXE file is called <b>exe</b>. Here is an example
of such file:

<pre>
[krun]
exe = "c:\myPesPatch\PES2011_patched.exe"
</pre>

<div class="note">IMPORTANT: if the path to or the filename of your EXE 
contains a non-ANSI character, you MUST save the file in UTF-8 encoding.
Otherwise it will not be read correctly.
</div>

<p>
That's it. Now when you double-click on <b>krun.exe</b>, instead of reading
the location of the game from registry, it will launch the EXE that is 
specified in <b>krun-config.txt</b>.
</p>

<h5>Renaming/copying krun.exe</h5>

<p>
This perhaps can be called an "advanced" trick, and may be useful to
patchmakers: you can rename krun.exe to something else, and it will still
be able to find its configuration file, if you also name it correctly.
</p>

<p>
For example, let's say your called it 
<span class="devnote">MyPatchRun.exe</span>. Then you need
to call the configuration file: 
<span class="devnote">MyPatchRun-config.txt</span>.
</p>

<h5>Nothing happened! What do i do?</h5>

<p>So you double-clicked on krun.exe, but nothing happened - the game
did not start. The most common reason for that is mistyped path of the
EXE in krun-config.txt, but there could be other reasons too.</p>

<p>First, wait a few seconds: it can sometimes take several seconds for 
the game to launch with Kitserver.</p>

<p>If after 5-10 seconds, the game does not start, check <b>krun.log</b>
file. It should have an explanation there on what went wrong. (If you 
renamed your krun.exe to MyPatchRun.exe, then the log file would also
be named accordingly: MyPatchRun.log)</p>

<h5>3.4. Running the game without Kitserver</h5>

<p>You can always run the game without Kitserver.<br />
Just launch it the normal way, as you would - through the Start Menu or
via a shortcut on your Desktop. If you don't use <b>krun</b> utility, then
Kitserver is not loaded into memory with the game.</p>

<p>This is handy for troubleshooting crashes, for example. Things go wrong 
no matter what, so the first thing you'd want to do is to isolate a problem. 
You will want to know if the Kitserver is causing a crash, or if something else is at fault. Launching the game without Kitserver is a good first step to
see what's causing the issue.
</p>


<p><a class="backlink" href="#">Top</a></p>
<h3>4. Configuration</h3>

<h5>4.1. Main configuration file: config.txt</h5>

<p>Kitserver uses a file called <b>config.txt</b> as its main 
configuration file. A lot of things are specified there, including which 
modules to load, what settings those modules should use, and etc. 
Here is an example of what can be in config.txt:
</p>

<pre>
[afs2fs]
img.dir = "c:\mypesfiles\root1"

[kload]
dll = fserv.dll
dll = kserv.dll
dll = afs2fs.dll
dll = speeder.dll
dll = sides.dll
dll = lodmixer.dll

</pre>

<p>
Each module can have its own configuration section, which starts with <b>[<i>module-name</i>]</b>, and typically has one or more options following it. Now, normally you wouldn't need to modify config.txt file, except for the cases, when you need to modify the behaviour of a particular module (DLL), or enable/disable such DLL.
</p>

<p>To disable a particular module - just comment out the corresponding line in the <b>[kload]</b> section by putting a '#' symbol at the beginning. (Or you can delete that line altogether.)
</p>

<p class="note">The order of the DLLs is important. In particular: 
<b>kserv.dll</b> and <b>fserv.dll</b> must be loaded before <b>afs2fs.dll</b>.
Only in very rare situations you should try re-arranging the DLLs.
</p>

<a name="config"><br /></a>
<h5>4.2. Configuration tool - config.exe</h5>

<p>Formerly known as lodcfg.exe (it used to be the GUI tool for LOD mixer 
only, but now it covers other configuration options as well), this simple 
GUI program allows to modify some configuration settings in config.txt. 
It's a helper tool and all that it does, you can also do manually, by 
editing config.txt in your favourite text editor. <span class="note">In fact, 
some things you can <i>only</i> do manually - like adding and removing 
modules (DLLs)</span>. But for simple things - like changing game speed or
fine-tuning the LOD levels, it's faster and easier to just launch 
<b>config.exe</b>, quickly adjust things, then click [Save] button, and 
you're done.

<h3>5. AFS2FS Module (afs2fs.dll)</h3>

<p>
This module allows to organize your BIN-files into folders on disk, instead of inserting them into AFS(*.img) files, which is sometimes a pain, and may require a lot of extra disk space.
</p>

<p>Several people over the last few years had suggested similar solutions, but ultimately it was <b>Str@teG</b> who kept talking about this idea of organizing BINs into folders, and eventually i decided to just go ahead and do it. So now this is realized in the this module - afs2fs.dll. From personal experience, i know that people are sometimes reluctant to install big patches that require an AFS-rebuild, not because it's particularly difficult or anything, but because it can be time-consuming and disk-space-hungry. With afs2fs, this is now very easy: you just put the BIN into correct folder and that's it. And, of course, there are no size constraints - the bins can be as large as needed!
</p>

<p>The module is also handy, when you want to try a patch without risking
totally destroying the content that you already have. Putting a new patch into
a separate AFS-root and modifying config.txt is all you need to get it going.
Removal as easy too: delete the correspoding "img.dir" line in config.txt, and
then delete the AFS-root folder. Multiple patches is no longer a management nightmare :). (See more info on AFS-roots in the sections below)</p>

<h5>5.1. How to set up the folders</h5>

<p>
Start by choosing a location where you would be putting your files. 
For example, let's take <b>c:\mypesfiles\root1</b>. This will be your so-called
AFS-root. Inside that folder, create a folder called <b>img</b>. (This is 
very important that you have the folder named "img", since the game relies
on particular names). Then, inside <b>img</b>, create folders, as needed, 
named - <b>dt00.img</b>, <b>dt01.img</b>, <b>dt0b.img</b>, and so for. 
That's where you're going to be putting the BIN-files. 
</p>

<p class="note">It's important to name the folders correctly: a folder must 
have exactly the same name as the corresponding AFS-file. For instance, 
if you call a folder dt00, instead of dt00.img, things will not work.
</p>

<p>This is how my <b>img</b> folder looks:

<img src="afs2fs.png"/>
</p>

<h5>5.2. How to name the files</h5>

<p class="devnote">In general, you can name the files whichever way you want, but you must follow one rule: there must be a BIN number in the name, and it must be preceded by an underscore character ('_'). Also, the filenames CANNOT be longer than 63 characters.
</p>

<p>
Examples of correctly named files:<br /><br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">unknown_317.bin</span><br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">goalnet_41.bin</span><br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">ball_9.bin</span><br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">unknow_9</span> (.bin extension is optional)<br />
<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">music_11.adx</span> (a file can have a different extension: .adx is typically used for music and sound files)<br />
</p>

<p>
Examples of incorrectly named files:<br /><br />
<span style="color:#800;font-weight:bold">unnamed10.bin</span> - no underscore symbol before the BIN number.<br />
<span style="color:#800;font-weight:bold">face.bin</span> - no BIN number.<br />
</p>

<h5>5.3. AFS roots</h5>
<p>
By default, the AFS2FS module will not search any "special" default paths. Instead you must specify your AFS roots explicitly: In <b>[afs2fs]</b> section of config.txt, you can speficy the location of your root, which can be anywhere on your hard disk. You can also have multiple roots, which is very useful if you have several patches, and you don't want to lose track of which BINs came from which patches (so that you can easily uninstall a patch by just deleting its root folder). 
</p>

<p>Here is an example with 3 different roots are configured:</p>

<pre>
[afs2fs]
img.dir = "c:\mypesfiles\root1"
img.dir = "patch-RPL"
img.dir = "afs-root3"
</pre>

<p>
The order of the roots is significant, when it comes to resolving "collisions". Say, you have a <b>dt0b.img/ball_9.bin</b> in the second root (patch-RPL), and <b>dt0b.img/superball_9.bin</b> in the third root (afs-root3). Even though the files are actually named differently, they intend to replace the same BIN - #9 from dt0b.img, and therefore we have a "collision". <span class="devnote">The rule is simple: the lower root in the list wins.</span> Which means that in this situation, the <b>dt0b.img/superball_9.bin</b> file will be used, since its root is listed last in the [afs2fs] section.</p>

<p class="note">IMPORTANT thing to remember: 
The root is the folder that <i>contains</i> "img", not the "img" folder itself. In other words, if the full pathname is <b>c:\mypesfiles\root1\img"</b>, then in the config.txt you should have: <b>img.dir = "c:\mypesfiles\root1"</b>
</p>

<h5>5.4. Names for balls and songs</h5>
<p>
When replacing songs with AFS2FS, it is also possible to change the title of the song and the artist's name, by using a <b>songs.txt</b> map-file, which should be put into afs-root folder.<br />
<br />
Here's an example of such songs.txt file:
</p>

<pre>
# Song names map
# Format: &lt;binId&gt;, "&lt;title&gt;", "&lt;artist&gt;" 
# Note that double quotes are required.

44, "I'm mad about you", "Sting"
45, "Вне зоны доступа", "Город 312"
</pre>

<p class="devnote" style="font-weight:normal">IMPORTANT: as with all other map-files and config files that Kitserver uses, 
the encoding of the file needs to be <b>Utf-8</b> or <b>Unicode</b>, especially
of you use non-latin symbols - like in the example above. (<b>ANSI</b> encoding
is ok if you only use Latin-1 characters.)
</p>

<p>
Similarly with balls, if you are replacing ball BINs, you probably want to
adjust their names too. One easy way to do that is to use a <b>balls.txt</b> map-file, which should be put into afs-root folder:

<pre>
# Ball names map
# Format: &lt;ball-number&gt;, "&lt;name&gt;"
# Note that double quotes are required.
# (Ball numbers go from 1 to 16)

8, "Nike-ball Blue"
9, "Мячик плохонький"
</pre>

<p>It is worth noting that each afs-root folder can have its own songs.txt
and balls.txt. Since each afs-root may contain music files and ball files,
it makes sense to tie the names to them this way. If you have multiple afs-roots(as when for example you have multiple patches, and each patch uses its own
afs-root), then the "conflicts" are resolved the same way as they are with BINs (see above for details). In other words, if one afs-root has name for song 11, and another afs-root has a name for song 11, then whichever afs-root is specified lower in the list (in config.txt) - will win.</p>

<p>Here's a picture to clarify where <b>songs.txt</b> and <b>balls.txt</b> files should be placed. In this case "root1" is my afs-root:

<h3>6. Kserv Module (kserv.dll)</h3>

<p>
Kserv module is responsible for serving kits from the GDB ("<b>G</b>ame content <b>D</b>ata<b>B</b>ase") during the game. The main feature of it is that you are not limited to the slots that dt0c.img has for the kits, and you can assign a kit to any team. 
</p>

<p class="devnote" style="font-weight:normal">
Kserv was historically the first module implemented in the original Kitserver program, made for PES3. That's where the <b>Kitserver</b> name originated from. Later, as more functionality were introduced as new modules, to avoid confusion, we changed the name of the module that serves kits to <b>kserv</b>, while Kitserver name now refers to the entire program.
</p>

<h5>6.1 GDB organization</h5>

<p>
The GDB contains a folder named <b>uni</b>, which is responsible for storing
the team kits (uniforms). The single most important file inside <b>uni</b> is called <b>map.txt</b>.
This file tells kitserver where to find the kits for particular team. As you know, each team has a unique id - an integer number from 0 to 370. For every team in the GDB, you must specify in the map.txt where the kits for this team are. Here is an example:

<pre>
# This config maps team number into folder name
# Format: &lt;team-num&gt;,"&lt;folder name&gt;"
# Example: 23,"Russia"

23,"National\Russia"
7, "National\England"
88, "EPL\Arsenal"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<div class="note">IMPORTANT: Double quotes are not required, but advised - just so that there is no ambiguity about folder name. IDs for the teams will depend on whether you have installed any patches, but for default option file, you can see the IDs here - <a href="uni.txt">uni.txt</a> file.</div>
</p>

<p>
Please note that the sample GDB (provided with kitserver) is just one possible way of organizing the teams and 
folders. It uses "EPL" folder to group all english teams, "National" - to group all national
teams, and so for. You may find that you just prefer a flat list of folders - without these
extra groups. In that case, just modify the <b>map.txt</b> file accordingly, and create
the structure of folders that you prefer. That's the main advantage of having map.txt - the
flexibility of kit organization.
</p>

<p>
You can see from map.txt above that in order to find a kit for team #88, the kitserver needs to go to the 
folder <b>GDB\uni\EPL\Arsenal</b>. This folder will contain all of the kits that are
available to team #88. Inside it, you must create an individual folder for each kit. Like this:

<img src="arsenal.png"/>

For players, 1st kit must have a folder name <b>pa</b>, 2nd - <b>pb</b>. Extra kits can have 
any folder names that start with letter "p". I found it useful to prefix all extra kits with 
<b>px-</b>. For example, <b>px-redwhite</b>. For the goalkeepers, 1st kit must be in the folder
<b>ga</b>, 2nd - in the <b>gb</b>. Extra kits can have any folder names that start with letter "g".
</p>

<div class="note">IMPORTANT: Folder name acts as a kind of ID for kitserver, which puts the 
additional restriction on all those folder names: they cannot contain spaces, and preferably
they should be relatively short, and in English,French or other language withing Latin1 
(iso8859-1) character set. Typically, if you want to make sure kitserver can properly
find/read the folder, just use latin characters, digits, underscore, and the dash (minus sign).
</div>

<p>
Now let's move on inside one of the kit folders. Take <b>pa</b>, for example.

<img src="pa.png" />

See the table below for explanation of each file:
</p>

<div class="note">Images must be in PNG format: 8-bit paletted or 4-bit paletted (those may be used with fonts/numbers). So the filename must have 
a ".png" extension.</b></div>

<h5>6.2. config.txt</h5>

<p>
This is the attribute configuration file.
As before, it is just a plain text file - you can use Notepad or any other text editor to
view or modify it. For each folder, you should have a <b>config.txt</b> file in it. Here is an example config.txt from <b>pa</b> folder:
</p>

<pre>

<h5>6.3. "Techfit" models</h5>

<p>In their DLC updates, KONAMI included new models which use different kit
textures - the one where two variants of a kit coexist in the same picture:
a tight fit, and a normal one.</p>

<p>Only certain models support those textures, and as of DLC 2.00, they
are: 35,36,37,38,39,40 and 41. Kserv module 11.0.0.0 supports those 
without any additional configuration. However, if another update is released
and more models like that are added, it is now possible to specify them
in the [kserv] section of config.txt. You need to list <b>all</b> of them 
like this:
</p>

<pre>
[kserv]
...
techfit.model = 35
techfit.model = 36
techfit.model = 37
techfit.model = 38
techfit.model = 39
techfit.model = 40
techfit.model = 41
...
</pre>

<h5>6.4. "Tight" models</h5>

<p>Another type of special model is Puma Tight-fit, model 24.
It allows to make any normal kit become tight-fitting kit (good examples of
that are kits worn by African teams)</p>

<p>As of DLC 2.00, only 24 is a model like and Kserv module 11.0.0.0 
supports those without any additional configuration. However, if another 
update is released and more models like that are added, it is possible to 
specify them in the [kserv] section of config.txt. You need to list <b>all</b>
of them like this:
</p>

<h3>7. Faceserver (fserv.dll)</h3>

<p>
Faceserver makes it possible to load as many faces and hair from the GDB as 
you want. So, you can assign each player a unique face/hair combination, if 
you want to, including custom created players. Faceserver makes use of unique 
ids, which are assigned to each player, and it creates "virtual" face and 
hair slots, that only exist during run-time. 
</p>

<img src="fserv.jpg"/>

<h5>7.1. How to find out ID for a player</h5>
<p>
If you have faceserver enabled (which it is by default), just start the game, and then in the <b>kitserver</b> folder, there should appear a text file called <span style="color:#060"><b>playerlist.txt</b></span>. It will contain the IDs for all the players that you have in your game, sorted alphabetically for easy searching, including the user-defined players that were created from scratch in Edit mode (those typically take IDs starting from 1048576).
</p>

<p>The only player ID not available in playlist.txt file is the ID for you BAL (Be-A-Legend) player. However, it looks like that ID is always: 16777376.
</p>

<h5>7.2. How to configure</h5>
<p>
Faceserver uses a map file (<b>GDB/faces/map.txt</b>), similar in format to Kserv: you specify player's unique ID, followed by a filename for his face, and optionally followed by a filename for his hair:<br />
</p>
<p class="devnote">{ID}, {face-file}, {hair-file}</p>

<p>
The filenames are relative to <b>GDB/faces</b> folder, but inside that you're free to organize them whichever way you want: either one flat directory, or a folder hierarchy. The only important thing is that you correctly specify the paths in the map.txt. The double-quotes around filenames are optional.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of entries in map.txt:

<pre>
# Example 1: face and hair BINs:
36556, chicharito_face.bin, chicharito_hair.bin

# Example 2: face only (fetched from a "Mexico" folder inside "faces"):
36556, "Mexico\chicharito_face.bin"

# Example 3: hair only (notice 2 commas!)
36556, , chicharito_hair.bin
</pre>
</p>

<h5>7.3. Network play</h5>
<p>
Faceserver should work fine in all online modes, although i have not 
done a lot of testing with it. Ranking and Friendly matches were successfully
played with faces/hairs assigned through faceserver.

<h3>8. LOD Mixer (lodmixer.dll)</h3>

<p>
LOD-Mixer is the module that allows to fine-tune some aspects of PES2011 graphics engine.<br />
These settings can be configured manually in kitserver's main 
configuration file (kitserver/config.txt), but it is probably easier 
to use Kitserver's <a href="#config">configuration tool</a> 
(<b>config.exe</b>). 
</p>

<p>
<img src="config-video.png" />
</p>

<h5>8.1. Aspect Ratio.</h5>
<p>
Many LCD monitors are neither 4:3 nor 16:9. Often, a 16:10 ratio is
used, or even 16:9.6. This results in the picture being distored: players either
too fat or too skinny, and ball is not round. In this year version, Konami 
are again using the black bars (as in PES2009 and PES2010) to compensate for the
case when aspect-ratio is different (<b>LB</b> checkbox). However, if you 
don't like the black bars, then run settings.exe, turn off the LB checkbox, and then use Kitserver's aspect-ratio correction feature instead:
</p>

<p>
With LOD Mixer, you can set the aspect ratio to whatever you want. Either let
LOD Mixer calculate it automatically - at run-time, using the current screen
width and height in pixels - or set the value manually. Automatic way would work quite
accurately, assuming the pixel is square. Sometimes, however, you would want to
set it manually. For example, i play on widescreen monitor, but using a 800x600 
resolution, because my video card is not powerful enough. The automatic 
calculation would give 4:3, but since the view is stretched to fill the entire 
screen, we need to account for that. Setting aspect ratio to 1.6 (which is a 
natural AR for my laptop) does the trick.
</p>

<h5>8.2. Screen Resolution.</h5>
<p>
You can set any screen resolution you want, if you play in a Windowed mode. Even
crazy screens like 1234x487 will work, but you're likely to suffer from 
performance problems on such cases.
Hidden fullscreen resolutions are fully unlocked now as well. However, only those
that your video card really supports in full-screen mode, will work. If you 
accidently choose an unsupported fullscreen resolution, then PES should still 
be able to start in a window.
</p>

<h5>8.3. Picture Quality</h5>
<p>
Although this is now a rare case, there are still situations, where the
game (and the settings.exe) do not correctly analyze the capability of the
video card, and because of that can erroneously disable "Medium" and "High"
picture quality settings.
</p>

<p>
If you are a "lucky" one with a card like that, LOD mixer can help you play
with a better picture quality. Selecting one of the settings - Low, Medium,
or High - will override the choice made in settings.exe, and will also 
disable any video compatibility checks that the game makes. Therefore, be
careful with this feature: if you video card does NOT indeed support the
chosen picture quality, the game will most likely crash or exit abnormally.
</p>


<h5>8.4. Player and referees LOD configuration.</h5>
<p>
LOD (Level-Of-Detail) algorithms are used in graphics engines to improve both
the picture quality and the speed of rendering, when drawing objects at various
distances from the viewer. The basic idea is that when the object is close to
the camera, one (very detailed) model is used. When it is far - another, simpler
model with less detail is used instead. It's much faster to render a low-poly
model of the object, and it typically looks better, when drawn in small size,
because it suffers less from aliasing. In theory, at least, 
that is how it is supposed to work.
</p>
<p>PES 2011 has 4 different ways it can render a player. The choice of the
rendering used at any given moment depends on several circumstances: how far
the player is from the camera, is this an active player (currently controlled
by human), is this a gameplay rendering or a replay, and so for. Here's the picture that shows how these LODs differ visually:
</p>
<p><img src="lodswitches.png" />
</p>
<p>
Notice the <b>S1</b>, <b>S2</b>, <b>S3</b> labels, which are placed among the
four renderings. You can think of them as "switches" from one type of rendering
to another. (For instance, S1 controls when the game engine switches from 
drawing a player at full detail to drawing the same player at slightly less
detail.) This is what the S1,S2,S3 means that you see in the 
<a href="#config">configuration tool</a> UI.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, PES series had always suffered from an overly-
conservative LOD configuration, where the switch to low-poly models would 
happen way too soon, and that would result in various visible artifacts. 
In PES4-PES6, examples were: balding players, and missing details on kits. 
In PES2008-PES2011, the players and referees appear to have blurred generic 
faces, once they move slightly away from the camera.
</p>
<p>
So, if you have a good PC and a powerful videocard with GPU cycles to spare, 
you may fancy tuning the LOD sligtly to make the game engine display more 
detailed models, even when they players are a bit away from the camera 
(Animation quality seems to be affected by this as well). To do that, 
<b>move the sliders to the right.</b>
</p>
<p>
Also, if on the contrary, your machine is struggling to run the game at a 
smooth frame rate, you can try moving the LOD sliders in the opposite 
direction - thus making the engine switch to the low-poly models sooner than 
normal. This may improve the framerate, although at the expense of picture 
quality. To achieve that, <b>move the sliders to the left.</b>
</p>

<h5>8.5. Choosing optimal LOD config</h5>

<P>
Configuring LOD well takes time and is best done via trial-and-error method. 
(If it was easy, it would've been probably done right in the first place!) 
I'd like to mention a few considerations here that should help 
you with LOD configs.</p>

<p><span class="devnote">Myth #1: if I move all sliders to the right, 
I will always have the best picture.</span><br />
That is simply not true. You will get the most detailed and expensive 
rendering, yes, but NOT NECESSARILY the one that looks the best. 
More-detailed objects at far distance actually look worse than 
less-detailed ones, because of the aliasing effect.</p>

<p><span class="devnote">Myth #2: my GPU (video card) is really good, surely it can handle anything thrown at it.</span><br />
That is not true either. Current generation of games has become 
quite sofisticiated and resource-hungry. GPU and CPU are working hard to 
process the rendering, physics, AI logic. 60 FPS is the typical minimum 
frame-rate at which a game needs to run, in order to provide nice and 
smooth gameplay. That means the rendering of the entire scene must fit 
into 1/60th of a second and still leave some time for other tasks to be 
done. (Physics, in particular is often run at the same rate as rendering, 
so that the picture doesn't suffer from noise.) To make sure rendering 
time doesn't escalate dramatically as more objects are rendered, LOD is 
often employed as an optimization technique. By moving all sliders to 
the right, you are effectively disabling the LOD algorithm and telling 
your GPU: "render all objects on the screen at the most possible detail. 
And if you fry while doing that, i don't care!". Ok, so maybe it's 
not a funny example, but you get the point.</p>

<p>Now, coming back to our game, as i said, in many cases, you only really 
need to adjust 1 slider or two to get the desired effect, and still keep 
the smooth frame-rate. Let's consider some examples:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Problem:</b> during regular gameplay, the game engine switches to low-quality models of players too soon, so we have artifacts like washed-out faces, untucked shirts suddenly become tucked-in, players models become too robot-like. <b>Solution:</b> slide "PLAYERS (Gameplay) S3" slider to the right - around 0.060 or maybe 0.050. That should take care of it. You may also want to try moving the S2 slider to something around 0.70, but on my card that didn't really give noticeable difference.
    <img src="lod1.png"/></li>

    <li><b>Problem:</b> during free-kicks, the faces of the players in the wall are all washed-out, even though they can be pretty close to the camera. Similarly - with corners.<b>Solution:</b> move the 
    "PLAYERS (Cut-scenes, Highlights, etc.) S3" slider to the right. The value 0.050 should be enough.
    <img src="lod2.png"/></li>

    <li><b>Problem:</b> referees suffer from the same problems as described above - during both gameplay and during replays. <b>Solution:</b> move the REFEREES sliders to the right. Again, you don't really need to max them out - something around 0.060 - 0.050 should be good.
    <img src="lod3.png"/></li>

    <li><b>Problem:</b> during free kick, the player that is taking it is not
    rendered with full detail, even though i have all LOD sliders set to maximum
    quality. <b>Solution:</b> use the "Active Player, FK" LOD setting, set "S1" slider to something like 0.045.
    <img src="lod4.png"/></li>
</ol>

<p>These are just some examples. You might notice some other artifacts that you'd like to fix.
The main thing is: experiment with your LOD configuration, don't just blindly set everything 
to maximum quality - on most systems that will result in stuttering and loss of frame-rate, because your 
GPU (and CPU also) gets a lot more work to do. In many cases, adjusting just one or two sliders gets the 
effect you want, without hurting the frame-rate.</p>

<h3>9. Speeder module (speeder.dll)</h3>

<p>Not everyone is satisfied with the pace of the gameplay. It must be said
that it is not an easy thing to get this aspect of simulating a football 
match correctly. Many factors are in play, and a lot depends on hardware. 
Personally, i think Konami did a decent job at that, but many folks find
the gameplay too fast.</p>

<p>Several techniques of slowing the game down exist, and not one of them
is perfect, but all work to some extent. The speeder module basically slows
down the clock, sort of tricking the game into running slower. This is not
an ideal solution either, but if a small adjustment is used, it can still
look real, play well, and actually provide a smoother gameplay. Don't
consider it a silver bullet though. It might work well for you, but it 
also may not deliver everything you had hoped for :) (One side-effect,
for example, is that if you set your match time to 10 minutes, but you
have the Game Speed set to 0.9, the actual match time will be approximately
11.1 minutes.)</p>

<p>It is possible to decrease the game speed and also to increase it.
The value <b>1.0</b> gives the default unchanged speed. Less than 1.0 - slower
gameplay, greater than 1.0 - faster gameplay. <span class="devnote">It is not advised to use values lower than 0.7, because the music/commentary starts to break up. Also values larger than 2.5 are not supported. It is already ridiculously fast with 2.5!</span>.
</p>
<p>Use configuration tool to adjust the game speed:<br />
<img src="config-speed.png" />
</p>
<p>
You can also set the game speed adjustment manually in config.txt, 
by using <b>count.factor</b> setting:

<pre>
[speeder]
count.factor = 0.95
</pre>
</p>

<h3>10. Sides module (sides.dll)</h3>

<p>This module allows to change sides freely during non-exhibition matches.
Useful, if you like to play tournaments with your friends, and want them to
play for your opponents, instead of always playing against the CPU.</p>

<p>By default, free selection of sides is disabled. To enable it, click
the <b>Free sides selection</b> checkbox in configuration tool, and press
[Save] button.<br />

<img src="config-sides.png" />
</p>
<p>Or, as always, you can edit the config.txt file, "sides" section, 
and set <b>free.select</b> option
to 1, like shown here:

<pre>
[sides]
free.select = 1
</pre>
</p>
